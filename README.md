# **Java-1**

This is a repo dedicated to the stuff that I am learning in Codecademey. It's public so people may help and fork!

## _How to compile?_

- First go to your Java terminal.
- Type in `javac exampleprogram.java`
- If no errors occured, then you should have a .class file in the name of your java program.
